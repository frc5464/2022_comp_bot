# 2022_comp_bot
Roborio code for 5464's 2022 competition robot, KITT.
This repo was set up after the season, and does not have the full commit history.
What did we learn from this season?
- Subsystems would be really helpful to organize things!
- Mecanum drive is SLIPPERY for auto!
- Colored object detection is not impossible!
